# OIL SPILL DETECTION ON SEA SURFACE USING SAR IMAGES

In this project we aim to develop an image processing pipeline for automated analysis of SAR images to detect oil spills on ocean surface and hence try to contribute towards the timely identification of the affected regions which will greatly help in marine pollution monitoring.
